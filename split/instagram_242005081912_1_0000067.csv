Both draped in the Brazilian flag. ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· I wrote a book called Like a Love Story inspired by her. She wrote a book called The Adventures of Abdi inspired by me ha ðŸ˜‚ Seriously though, eu sou proud of two of my greatest inspirations - Madonna and Brasileiros - for showing the world what pure defiant queer joy looks like. Her Rio show is already in the history books as the biggest standalone concert by any artist ever (!!) but it isnâ€™t holding records that makes her the queen. Itâ€™s her barrier breaking bravery, her refusal to let others define her, her commitment to the labor of artistry, her commitment to queer rights before anyone in her position would risk their success for us, her persistent refusal to give up curiosity for all the world has to offer and all new generations and cultures can teach us. Forever my biggest inspiration. Iâ€™m so grateful for what she taught me about life, humor, curiosity, art, longevity. As for Brasileiros, you are the ultimate fofos always and youâ€™ve taught me so much about how to enjoy and appreciate life.
