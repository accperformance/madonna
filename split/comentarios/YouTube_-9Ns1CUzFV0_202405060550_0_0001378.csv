M and Taylor have performed together and as far I know, respect each other. However, I do doubt that Taylor would get as big of a crowd, and that&#39;s not because she isn&#39;t popular or talented, it&#39;s because she hasn&#39;t had as long a career. Most people over, say, 25, probably don&#39;t really like her music very much. Madonna&#39;s career spans generations... young kids are discovering her music and older fans might be up to their 60s or so. IF Taylor lasts as long as Madonna, then yes, possibly she&#39;s break records... but her career hasn&#39;t been as long and significant as Madonna&#39;s, and that&#39;s no shade.",YouTube,NEUTRAL,0,UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg,-9Ns1CUzFV0,"@@phoenix5054 The original post was silly, there&#39;s no reason to assume Taylor Swift would be or needs to be jealous.
