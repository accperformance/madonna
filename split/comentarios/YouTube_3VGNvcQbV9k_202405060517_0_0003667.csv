It was definitely worth the wait after all of these years. She did some amazing classics but I gotta admit that I was just a little bummed that she did an acoustic version of Express Yourself, BUT at least she did it lol. Omg, experiencing Rain live which she hasn&#39;t done since The Girlie Show Tour in 1993 or 1994 was ABSOLUTELY amazing. Also Live To Tell was so sad yet beautiful all wrapped into one, I have to admit that I cried during it. I actually cried during a couple songs to be honest.
