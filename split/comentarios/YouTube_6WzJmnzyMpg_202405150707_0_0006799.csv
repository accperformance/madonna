She has always played with religious iconography, sexual themes etc in her shows, and she's been doing it for over 30 years, so this isn't new.

Some people here are (annoyingly) ridiculing and overreacting in horror at the ""perceived sacrilege"" and blah blah blah, like all the scantily-clad sensual performance is an outrage. What does it matter if her kids were there? As if it was humanly possible to hide her magnitude from them and what she's done in the past years. They could simply look it up online. 

Speaking about the Internet, the world is becoming ridiculously overly sexualized anyway. Or didn’t you notice?! Why is nobody talking about social media and the wannabes? Tiktok, onlyfans, etc? Your kids or relatives (or even you) might be there ""creating (explicit) content,"" and you're here denigrating Madonna, which quite frankly won't even bother with these boring comments.
