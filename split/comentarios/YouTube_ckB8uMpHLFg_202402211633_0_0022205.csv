I&#39;ve seen her perform at extraordinarily high levels! Yes, she&#39;s older now, and her show looks different. She&#39;s using more &quot;tricks of the trade&quot; or whatever but I don&#39;t care. She&#39;s still an incredibly important figure in the world of music and culture and MY world. She&#39;s a living legend. I&#39;ll never understand why people want to tear her down. She&#39;s done so much good in this world. She&#39;s just having fun now as she should. She&#39;s not doing it for the money.
