I’m brazilian and I follow your content since 2021. I’m so glad you could had a great time here at Madonna show! But unfortunately while the show was happening at Rio de Janeiro, my state at the south Rio Grande do Sul was and still is suffering the worst natural disaster we ever witnessed in the history of our state. Around 300 of the 497 cities in here were hit by the massive flood cause by the increased volume in our rivers. I live in the capital where it’s supposed to have more structure than the country side and 70% of us don’t have water supply and many without electricity. Several houses are flooded and many died, keep in mind that Brazil isn’t familiar with war like scenarios so we are really overwhelmed by everything that is happening. As always I love your content and I hope you made great memories ❤❤❤",YouTube,NEUTRAL,0,UCgF7YFF8z-J4nygkVhavWrQ,3VGNvcQbV9k,"Hii Nick! I’m brazilian and I follow your content since 2021.
