She is the last woman standing.
Not even Janet has made it this far. It must be a lonely place knowing that all of your contemporaries and competition are dead.
She has sold more than 400 million records and yet for many of us fans she is misunderstood, misinterpreted and under appreciated.
When Madonna dies, pop music as we have known it will die. We will be left with generic , uninspired and mediocre Arianas, Adeles, Katys, Duas and Co.
She is to pop what Liz Taylor was to old Hollywood. A true Icon and legend in a time when the two word are being thrown around too easily.
It was a blast to be alive in a time when Madonna ruled the world. Following her career was truly eye opening, educational, inspirational and a joyride.",@firouz256,https://yt3.ggpht.com/PEP1pr35d0SHC8DVnfqmNKhigtU9PqiKHjlJKqekDTo6-6f4mBk4bYuti_phWgdG5Fb8yh23fw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,http://www.youtube.com/@firouz256,{'value': 'UCJp8CxD2sHha9BUFsQ0j7MA'},True,none,14,2024-05-05T22:05:12Z,2024-05-05T22:05:12Z
